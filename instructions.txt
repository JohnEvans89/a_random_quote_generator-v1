In this project, you'll be tackling three main things:

Build a collection of quotations — these are the quotes, author
and other information that gets printed to the screen. You'll do this
by creating a JavaScript array containing JavaScript objects — one object for each quotation.
Create a function that pulls one of those quotes out at random.
Create a function that prints that quote to the screen
