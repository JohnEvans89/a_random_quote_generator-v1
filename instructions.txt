In this project, you'll be tackling three main things:

Build a collection of quotations — these are the quotes, author
and other information that gets printed to the screen. You'll do this
by creating a JavaScript array containing JavaScript objects — one object for each quotation.
Create a function that pulls one of those quotes out at random.
Create a function that prints that quote to the screen

Each quote object in the quotes array should have the following properties:
quote - a string containing the text of the quote that will be displayed on the page.
source - a string containing the creator of the quote. For example: "Mark Twain" or "Traditional Irish proverb” or "Anonymous".
citation - optional - a string identifying where the quote comes from, like a speech, publication or a movie. If there is no known publication, do not include this property on the object.
year - optional - a number identifying the year of the quote. If there is no known year, then do not include this property on the object.

Build the array of quote objects to store the quotes.
Write your own functions for selecting random quotes from the array and printing them to the screen.
