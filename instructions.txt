In this project, you'll be tackling three main things:

Build a collection of quotations — these are the quotes, author
and other information that gets printed to the screen. You'll do this
by creating a JavaScript array containing JavaScript objects — one object for each quotation.
Create a function that pulls one of those quotes out at random.
Create a function that prints that quote to the screen
-


The getRandomQuote function should create a random number, and use that random number to return a random quote object from the quotes array.
Create a function named getRandomQuote.
In the function body, create a variable to store a random number ranging from zero to the index of the last item in the quotes array.
Lastly, the function should return a random quote object using the random number variable above and bracket notation on the quotes array.

6. The getRandomQuote Function:
This function needs to accomplish three tasks: use Math.floor, Math.random and the length of the quotes array to generate a random number,
use bracket notation and the random number variable to grab a quote object from the quotes array, and lastly, return the random quote object.
To help you get started, you can copy the following code snippet directly into your script.js file and use the code comments to help guide you forward.

function getRandomQuote(quotes) {
var getRandom = [Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length)];
  return (getRandom);
};
}

function diceRoll (twelveSidedDie) {
var test = (Math.ceil(Math.random() * twelveSidedDie.length));
  return (test);
};
